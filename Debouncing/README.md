# Software Debouncing

When a button connected to a circuit is pressed, it permits or restricts current flow. The act of pressing a button down produces a pulse or step signal that feeds back into the circuit. However because of the mechanical nature of the button, upon being pressed the button will actually bounce back and forth a tiny distance before settling down, affecting the signal. This bouncing effect from the button can accidentally trigger the wrong event in our microcontrollers, because the interrupt corresponding to it can occur multiple times. In order to ensure the circuit responds correctly we can debounce the button press.

To debounce a button press, first the length of bouncing effect has to be identified. This can be done using an oscilloscope. Once length of time that the button bounces is known, are microcontrollers can be configured to wait for bouncing to stop before executing a function. After the initial rising or falling edge from the button press, the microcontroller can disable the interrupt associated with the button press and start a timer. The timer will last as long as the bouncing effect, when it stop the interrupt will be reset and the code associated with the interrupt can be executed. In this case, toggling an LED.
